Together with [Rami Masri](https://ramimasri.github.io/) I will be giving a course on the functional analytic backbone of finite element methods. The course will take place at Simula in March, you can find the registration form and a closer description [here](https://www.simula.no/education/courses/faefem-functional-analysis-essentials-finite-element-method).
